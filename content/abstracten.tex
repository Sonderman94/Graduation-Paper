    With the development of network technology, video has become the core carrier of information dissemination and entertainment consumption, and users' demand for interactivity on video platforms is growing. This paper designs and implements the back-end system of the barrage video website based on the Springboot framework. The system is based on online video playback and the barrage function as the core. It uses MySQL, FastDFS, WebSocket, Elasticsearch and other technologies to provide users with functions such as video playback, barrage interaction, likes and collections to meet the diverse needs of users. The system adopts a microservice architecture with good performance, availability, security, scalability and maintainability.
